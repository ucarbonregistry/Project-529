# Project-529
MMMOCL (Line-2A and Line-7)
The objective of the project activity is to register Line-2A and Line-7 of the Mumbai Metro
system under the UCR activity. The project is implemented and operated by Maha Mumbai
Metro Operation Corporation Limited (MMMOCL). The metro transportation system offers higher
efficiency compared to traditional road-based transport and achieves greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission reductions, calculated on a per passenger-kilometre basis. On average, the metro
system has significantly lower GHG emissions per passenger-kilometre than the modes of
transport it replaces in the absence of the project activity. This modal shift results in measurable
GHG emission reductions.
The total network length of the project is 35.1 km, comprising two fully elevated corridors:

• Line-2A: Dahisar (East) to Andheri (West) – 18.6 km, 17 stations

• Line-7: Ovaripada to Gundavali – 16.5 km, 13 stations

The combined total network length of the two lines is 35.1 km with the
metro system being fully elevated. Trains run on standard gauge (1435
mm) and consist of 6-car stainless steel rolling stock, with a width of
approximately 3.2 meters. The capacity of a 6-car train is approximately

1,756 passengers.

The trains operate at an average speed of 35 kmph
and a maximum speed of 80 kmph, with frequencies ranging from 6 to
10 minutes, depending on the time of day and passenger demand.

The track structure includes:

• Ballast less tracks on viaducts

• Ballasted tracks in depot areas
_______
The traction system is 25 kV AC, 50 Hz, single-phase, with power
supplied through a 110 kV/33 kV power distribution system, connected
to grid substations. Auxiliary systems are powered through a dedicated
33 kV ring main cable network along the alignment.

Projected ridership based on DPR forecasts:

• 2023: 10,04,722 passengers/day

• 2032: 13,11,648 passengers/day
